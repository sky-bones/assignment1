    <h2>There are ways to go about life and death.</h2>
        
    <p>However you choose to do it, they are both inevitably going to begin and end. There is something sneeringly indifferent about the universe in that context, the idea that life – the epitome of our apparent existence – can vanish and begin at random intervals.</p>
        
    <p>Even if you can be born from the salt of the ocean, as a creature that shouldn’t exist, your life hangs in the delicate thread of time.</p>
        
    <p>That is how I see my life. My perspective is perhaps larger then the average life, simply because I do not have the capacity of emotion. The grandness of that was the logical and wonderful patterns that could be seen in the threads of time.</p>
        
   <p>I am a witch.</p>
        
    <p>Would you like to continue to hear the story?</p>

       <div><p>I’m sort of glad you chose to hear more.</p> 

<p>I exist because I am a creature created by the universe. My purpose for existing is to extinguish life when it is no longer needed. Life is a currency for me. The more that I take, the longer I can survive. Because I must take life, I am able to change the existing structures of existence.  I can’t simply change time; I must change the structure of the existing elements around the time of a life.

       <d><p>Your understanding is not complete enough to activate my power. But I welcome the chance to see your time thread extend. </p></d>

        <p>Would you like to know how life is defined? </p>

            <p>Life that I can touch follows rules.</p>
            
            <ol>
            <li>it must have self preservation</li>
            <li>it must feel fear</li>
            <li>and above all, it must understand death.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>If these rules are met, I can disrupt the space surrounding the life and take it. </p>
            
            <p>While you may consider the rules redundant, they are a protection that has been instilled in life in order to preserve it.</p>
            
            <p>Self-preservation is a desire to keep the life intact, and to keep death as far away as possible. To forgo this idea, and invite death, means I can no longer alter the existence around you.</p>
            
            
            <p>To feel fear is linked to self-preservation. It is a distinct emotion found once self-preservation has been decided upon. Fear itself is a prevention of death, and a great and foreboding teacher of lessons. It can also trigger the act of self-preservation, and thus fulfilling two of the three rules. </p>
            
            <p>The third rule is to understand death. To preserve life, self-preservation and fear are intact. Death is a separate component of these actions. In order for life to truly understand death, it must have felt the presence, watched the action of death, or committed the act of death on another life.  Even with one of these scenarios filled, death may still be elusive to understand.  The true understanding of death can only be accomplished by understand both the end and beginning of life. The understanding of ending and beginning as separate but combined entities is the true meaning of death.</p>
            
            <p>Fortunately, most animals are born with these instincts. I don’t kill humans often, because there is almost always a component missing until very late in life. </p>
            
            <p>It’s become harder to find humans who understand death. My hunting area seems to be full of talk, and ideas about death, but it’s not in true sense. They speak of it because they have forgotten the fear of dying. The idea of death as a group has simple been nullified.</p>
            
            <p>Changing elements around a life is simple.</p>

            <p>perhaps it is best. To be given understanding that could allow you to be extinguished, can be qualified in my conditions. Your life line will extend, but I am much closer to changing the elements surrounding you.</p>
        </details>

            <p>the elements that have been referred to are simple particles. In order to change the surroundings, I simple change the particles. </p>
            
            <p>I am a witch after all.</p>
            
            <p>I can light fires in the air, by changing the elements. I can cause a tree to fall, by increasing the decomposing elements in it’s structure. </p>
            
            <p>In a sense, I can control anything made of particles.</p>
            
            <p>It’s a bit all-powerful. Whatever universal rule created me, created those rules in order to protect most life from being changed around. I suppose it makes it fair. </p>
            
            <p>But I’m no invincible. I am mortal, but the span of my existence is much greater then the average one. It can continue as long as my rules can be applied to a life.  I try to take only the amount of lives necessary to continue on. </p>
            
            <p>Now I suppose I should make this fair.</p>
            
            <p>You know how I can remove your life, and you should be able to remove mine. However my conditions are met, they will be met. I can take your life with you realizing that you have met the conditions.</p>

            <p>with your new found information, you cannot forget that you life hangs in the balance. However, this has unlocked a new condition.</p>
            
            <p>Because I have created the understanding, the other two conditions will be fulfilled.</p>
            
            <p>But because I have triggered the event, the condition of understanding life has been created to protect you.</p>
            
            <p>Because this is a life long journey, the possibility of changing your surrounding elements has become impossible.</p>

        <p>Would you like to know how to take my life?</p>

        <summary>Yes</summary>
            
            <p>Ah, the true nature of humanity.  The curiosity and ability to learn and change is a strength my species no longer posses. We have been created from the depths of ocean salt, and crumbled together with sulfur from high peaks.  I am created from the elements of the universe.</p>
            
            <p>In order to extinguish my life, you would need to understand my blood. As a creature based on the element of salt, my blood is both salt and carbon based. I bleed red, but I cannot create more blood cells.</p>
            
            <p>In assuming you can simply bleed me to death, you would only be half correct. Without blood, I would be slower and be incredibly weary.</p>
            
            <p>But I can live without blood. A salt-based creature can be killed by changing its’ element. In order to change salt, you must make it dissolve. </p>
            
            <p>The old story of witches melting was true. I will melt once my blood has been drained from my body.</p>
        
            <p>A bleeding witch is a dead one.</p>
            
            <p>You have everything you could need to know.</p>

            <p>I commend your honesty. You will live much longer I suppose, by making decisions that will extend both your life and the life of your opposite. </p>
            <p>Your thread of time will extend further then you imagined.</p>
        </details>
        
        
        <p>Would you like to know why I’ve told you all this?</p>

            <p>I am not capable of fear. By giving you information, it simple makes my hunting more interesting. I hunt to survive, and I survive to hunt. There is no way to beg my forgiveness. By giving you information, you may create your own change. You might invite death. You might seek out a witch.</p>
            
            <p>Humans are unpredictable. Perhaps you will extinguish me. Perhaps I will get to you first.</p>

            <p>By not knowing, you may have avoided a great mental blow.  Or you may suffer a greater one by not knowing.</p>
            
            <p>That choice is up to you.</p>
